# Traffic-_sign_classification

This project requires prior knowledge of Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PIL and image classification.

Our approach to building this traffic sign classification model is discussed in four steps:

Step 1: Explore the dataset

Step 2: Build a CNN model

Step 3: Train and validate the model

Step 4: Test the model with test dataset

Dataset :
   The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images.The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

Output look like this:
